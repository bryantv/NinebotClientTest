This is a client for Ninebot One E and E+, probably also for Ninebot One and new P.

Allows to record, manage and share data about each run :

  - Speed
  - Voltage
  - Current
  - Pitch
  - Roll
  - Distance
  - Time
  - Total Distance
  - Total Time
  - Remaining Distance
  - Battery level
  - Temperature
  - Pitch speed
  - Roll Speed
  - Flags (limit speed, ...)
  - Speed Limit
  
and some other variables of the wheel.

It uses the altimeter in the iPhone to store altitude variations synchronized with all other variables.

Also Speed, Temperature, Voltage, Current, Battery Leve, Pitch, Roll, Distance and altitude variation may be presented graphically.

All data is stored in simple text files and may be exported by AirDrop, mail, messages or to iCloud repositories using standard iOS sharing.
